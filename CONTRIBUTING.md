Use GitHub wiki or an external documentation platform like ReadTheDocs to create more expansive guides, developer notes, or user documentation, linking back to it from the repository.
Promote Repository Visibility:

Share the fork and updated README within relevant developer communities or forums to attract potential contributors who may be interested in engaging with the project.
Reflect and Iterate:

Take this opportunity to reflect on the process of adding documentation. Gather insights from the team on what worked well and where improvements could be made for future documentation updates.
Optimize Repository Settings:

Ensure the forked repository settings (visibility, topics, watchers) are optimized for engagement and visibility among the intended audience.

Remember the human.
